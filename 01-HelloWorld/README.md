# Hello World in Go

This repository contains a basic "Hello World" program written in the Go programming language.

## Code Explanation

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

### Breakdown:

- `package main`:  
  Defines the package name. In Go, the `main` package is special ‚Äî it tells the Go compiler that this is an executable program, not a shared library.

- `import "fmt"`:  
  Imports the `fmt` package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console.

- `func main() { ... }`:  
  Declares the `main` function ‚Äî the entry point of a Go program. When you run the program, the code inside `main` gets executed.

- `fmt.Println("Hello World")`:  
  Prints the text `Hello World` to the standard output (your terminal) followed by a newline.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have [Go installed](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Save the code in a file named `main.go`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing `main.go`.
4. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

5. You should see the output:

   ```
   Hello World
   ```
